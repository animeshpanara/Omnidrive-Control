Three Wheel Omnidrive
=====================
A three wheel omnidrive consists of three omniwheels mounted on a chassis and giving the wheels a correct set of RPM can make the robot move in all directions. Normally, the wheels are mounted near the periphery of the chassis and also the angle between the wheel/motor mountings is kept equilavent i.e. 120°
